# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-platform database GUI client that supports MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. The application consists of a web client (Next.js with TypeScript) for product showcase and account management, and a desktop application (Electron with React, Shadcn UI, and TailwindCSS) that provides full database connectivity and management features. The backend uses Supabase for authentication and payment management. The desktop client features a frameless window design, database connectivity, visual data exploration, query execution, and AI-powered assistance for SQL/MongoDB query generation and natural language database interactions.
