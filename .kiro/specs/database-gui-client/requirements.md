# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-platform database GUI client that supports MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. The application will be built as both a web client (Next.js with TypeScript) and desktop applications (Flutter for Windows/Mac), with a Node.js backend server (TypeScript). The client features database connectivity, visual data exploration, query execution, and AI-powered assistance for SQL/MongoDB query generation and natural language database interactions. The application includes user authentication and a payment system for AI features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connectivity

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to connect to different types of databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), so that I can manage multiple database systems from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a database type THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connection fields (host, port, username, password, database name)
2. WHEN a user provides valid connection credentials THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to the database
3. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL save connection details securely for future use
5. IF a connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 2: Database Navigation Interface

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to see a hierarchical tree view of databases and tables in the left panel, so that I can easily navigate and explore the database structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database connection is established THEN the system SHALL display a tree view of all databases in the left panel
2. WHEN a user expands a database node THEN the system SHALL show all tables/collections within that database
3. WHEN a user clicks on a table/collection THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected item
4. WHEN a user right-clicks on a table THEN the system SHALL show context menu options (view structure, sample data, etc.)
5. IF the database structure changes THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh option to update the tree view

### Requirement 3: Query Execution Interface

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want to input and execute SQL/MongoDB statements in a dedicated input area, so that I can query and manipulate data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a table/collection THEN the system SHALL display a query input box in the right top panel
2. WHEN a user types a query THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for the selected database type
3. WHEN a user executes a valid query THEN the system SHALL display results in the bottom panel
4. WHEN a user executes an invalid query THEN the system SHALL display error messages with line numbers
5. WHEN a user executes a query THEN the system SHALL track query execution time and row count

### Requirement 4: Data Visualization and Export

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to view query results in multiple formats (tree, table, JSON), so that I can analyze data in the most suitable format for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query results are returned THEN the system SHALL display data in the right bottom panel
2. WHEN a user clicks view mode buttons THEN the system SHALL switch between tree, table, and JSON views
3. WHEN displaying table view THEN the system SHALL support sorting, filtering, and pagination
4. WHEN displaying large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN a user wants to export data THEN the system SHALL provide export options (CSV, JSON, Excel)

### Requirement 5: AI SQL/MongoDB Query Generation

**User Story:** As a database user, I want an AI copilot to help generate SQL/MongoDB statements, so that I can create complex queries without memorizing syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes a query in natural language THEN the AI SHALL generate appropriate SQL/MongoDB syntax
2. WHEN AI generates a query THEN the system SHALL display the query in the input box for user review
3. WHEN a user requests query optimization THEN the AI SHALL suggest performance improvements
4. WHEN AI generates a query THEN the system SHALL explain what the query does in plain language
5. IF the AI cannot generate a query THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions or ask for clarification

### Requirement 6: AI Database Assistant Chatbot

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to interact with an AI chatbot using natural language instructions, so that the system can automatically search and retrieve data without me writing queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a natural language instruction THEN the AI SHALL interpret the request and generate appropriate queries
2. WHEN the AI executes automatic queries THEN the system SHALL display both the generated query and results
3. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the AI SHALL maintain context from previous interactions
4. WHEN the AI cannot understand a request THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions
5. WHEN the AI completes a task THEN the system SHALL summarize what was accomplished

### Requirement 7: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want users to create accounts and authenticate, so that I can provide personalized AI features and track usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the application THEN the system SHALL provide signup and login options
2. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL require email verification
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials securely
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL enable AI features
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL limit access to basic database connectivity features

### Requirement 8: Payment and Subscription System

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to implement a payment system for AI features, so that I can monetize the advanced functionality and maintain the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to access AI features THEN the system SHALL check for active subscription
2. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL process payment securely through a payment gateway
3. WHEN a subscription expires THEN the system SHALL disable AI features and notify the user
4. WHEN a user cancels subscription THEN the system SHALL maintain access until the current billing period ends
5. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL retry payment and notify the user of issues

### Requirement 9: Multi-Platform Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the database client on different platforms (web, Windows, Mac), so that I can work with databases regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node.js TypeScript backend is deployed THEN it SHALL provide REST APIs for all client applications
2. WHEN the web application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible through modern web browsers
3. WHEN the Flutter desktop app is built THEN it SHALL run natively on Windows and macOS
4. WHEN features are implemented THEN they SHALL maintain consistency across all platforms
5. WHEN data is synchronized THEN user preferences SHALL be consistent across platforms
6. IF platform-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 10: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my database credentials and data to be protected, so that sensitive information remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing connection credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear sensitive data from memory
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection regulations
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL log the incident and notify administrators
