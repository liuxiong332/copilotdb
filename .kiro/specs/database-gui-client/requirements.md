# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-platform database GUI client that supports MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. The application consists of a web client (Next.js with TypeScript) for product showcase and account management, and desktop applications (Flutter for Windows/Mac) that provide full database connectivity and management features. The backend uses Supabase for authentication and payment management. The desktop clients feature database connectivity, visual data exploration, query execution, and AI-powered assistance for SQL/MongoDB query generation and natural language database interactions.

### Requirement 6: Desktop Client - Database Navigation Interface

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to see a hierarchical tree view of databases and tables in the desktop client, so that I can easily navigate and explore the database structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user expands a database node THEN the desktop client SHALL show all tables/collections within that database
3. WHEN a user clicks on a table/collection THEN the desktop client SHALL highlight the selected item
4. WHEN a user right-clicks on a table THEN the desktop client SHALL show context menu options (view structure, sample data, etc.)
5. IF the database structure changes THEN the desktop client SHALL provide a refresh option to update the tree view

### Requirement 7: Desktop Client - Query Execution Interface
