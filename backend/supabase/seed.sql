-- Initial seed data for the database GUI client
-- This file contains minimal seed data for development and testing

-- Note: User profiles will be created automatically via trigger when users sign up
-- This seed file focuses on reference data and development helpers

-- No sample data inserted by default to avoid foreign key constraint issues
-- Real data will be created when users sign up and use the application

-- Sample data can be added manually after creating test users if needed for development
