# Database Connection Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed database connection functionality from the web client and backend services as per the new architecture where:
- **Web Client**: Product showcase, authentication, and payment management only
- **Desktop Clients**: Full database connectivity and management features
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and payments only

## Files Removed

### Database Types and Interfaces
- `packages/types/src/database.ts` - Database connection types
- `packages/types/src/database-specific.ts` - Database-specific configuration types
- `packages/types/src/__tests__/database.test.ts` - Database type tests
- `packages/types/src/__tests__/database-specific.test.ts` - Database-specific type tests

### Database Services
- `packages/shared/src/database-clients.ts` - Database client implementations
- `packages/shared/src/database-connection-service.ts` - Connection management service
- `packages/shared/src/database-schema-service.ts` - Schema retrieval service
- `packages/shared/src/database-query-service.ts` - Query execution service
- `packages/shared/src/database-utils.ts` - Database utility functions

### Test Files
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/database-connection-service.test.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/database-schema-service.test.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/database-query-service.test.ts`

## Dependencies Removed

### From packages/shared/package.json
- `mongodb: ^6.0.0`
- `mysql2: ^3.6.0`
- `pg: ^8.11.0`
- `sqlite3: ^5.1.6`
- `@types/pg: ^8.10.0`

## Files Updated

### packages/types/src/index.ts
- Removed exports for database and database-specific types
- Updated comments to reflect new architecture

### packages/shared/src/index.ts
- Removed exports for database services and utilities
- Updated comments to reflect new architecture

### packages/shared/src/constants.ts
- Removed `DATABASE_TYPES` constant
- Removed database-related API endpoints
- Simplified error codes for web client use
- Added download endpoints for desktop clients

### packages/shared/src/utils.ts
- Removed database-specific utility functions:
  - `parseConnectionString()`
  - `buildConnectionString()`
  - `sanitizeQuery()`
  - `extractTableNames()`
- Removed duplicate `validatePassword()` function
- Added web client-specific utilities

### packages/shared/src/validation.ts
- Removed all database connection validation functions
- Simplified to web client validation needs:
  - Email validation
  - Password validation
  - Name validation
  - General validation utilities

### packages/shared/src/encryption.ts
- Renamed `encryptConnectionConfig()` to `encryptData()`
- Renamed `decryptConnectionConfig()` to `decryptData()`
- Updated comments to reflect general encryption use

### packages/shared/package.json
- Updated description to reflect web client focus
- Removed database driver dependencies

### package.json (root)
- Updated description to reflect new architecture

## Architecture Impact

### Before Cleanup
- Web client could connect to databases directly
- Backend Edge Functions handled database operations
- Shared packages contained full database functionality

### After Cleanup
- Web client focuses on product showcase and account management
- Desktop clients will handle all database connectivity
- Shared packages provide only authentication and general utilities
- Backend (Supabase) handles only authentication and payments

## Next Steps

1. **Flutter Desktop Development**: Database connectivity code will be implemented directly in Flutter desktop applications
2. **Web Client Development**: Focus on Next.js application for product showcase, authentication, and subscription management
3. **Supabase Configuration**: Maintain only authentication and payment-related database schema

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Database connections happen locally in desktop clients, not through web/cloud
2. **Performance**: Direct database connections without web proxy layer
3. **Simplicity**: Clear separation of concerns between web and desktop clients
4. **Maintenance**: Reduced complexity in web client and backend services
